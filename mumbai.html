Bordering the Arabian Sea, this famous road is a popular spot for watching sunsets, and is gorgeous when lit up 
at night.The scenic beauty of the perfectly lined palm trees offers its visitors an enthralling experience. 
Marine Drive is also referred to as 'Queen's necklace', because the street lights make the road look like a 
string of pearls and create an illusion of a necklace, when viewed at night from any elevated point along the 
pathway of the drive.
